# Spam_Mail_Prediction_Analysis_Using_NLP

This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The project utilizes a logistic regression model combined with TF-IDF vectorization to classify emails as spam or non-spam.

It provides a comprehensive analysis of the email dataset, including preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and stop word removal.

The TF-IDF vectorization technique is employed to convert the textual data into numerical feature vectors for training the model.

The trained model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails, contributing to efficient email filtering.

The project includes sample code for training the model and making predictions on new email data.

It also demonstrates the evaluation of the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Detailed documentation is provided to guide users on how to replicate the experiment and adapt it to their own datasets.

By utilizing NLP and machine learning techniques, this project offers an effective solution for spam email detection, potentially improving email security and reducing inbox clutter.
